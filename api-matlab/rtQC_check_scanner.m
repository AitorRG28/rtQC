rtQC_id_artifacts
Identifies artifacts based on AQUA metrics by comparing each volume to reference data (e.g. the preceding volumes or volumes from a reference/good acquisition using the same sequence). Can get rid of spikes and weird volumes. It can also provide metrics of overall data quality, decomposed into movement metrics, signal metrics â€¦
